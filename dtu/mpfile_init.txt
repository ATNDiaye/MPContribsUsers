title: GLLB-SC Bandgaps

description:
Bandgaps calculated using GLLB-SC potential by Gritsenko, van
Leeuwen, van Lenthe, and Baerends (GLLB), adapted by Kuisma et al
to account for solids (-SC). The Kohn-Sham gap (ΔE-KS) most
basically refers to the energy difference between the bottom of
the conduction band and the top of the valence band. The
Quasi-Particle gap (ΔE-QP) takes into account the derivative
discontinuity (C) of the chemical potential and gives the bandgap
as the difference between ionization potential and electron
affinity.
