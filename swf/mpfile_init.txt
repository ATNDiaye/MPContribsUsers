explanation: The in-plane energy product, the maximum stored magnetic energy, is shown for a library of sputter deposited Fe-Co-V thin films. In addition, a comparison of MOKE screening to more traditional VSM measurements is detailed by coercive field (Î¼0HC) data. The composition of each thin film is also displayed with the accompanying entries.
