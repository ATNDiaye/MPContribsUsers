description:
We have measured thermodynamic data of perovskites ABO3-δ , i.e. ΔH and ΔS in
dependence of the non-stoichiometry δ by means of thermogravimetric analysis.
That means, we measured the mass changes in dependence of T and p(O2),
determined the corresponding non-stoichiometry changes and used this data to
extract thermodynamic properties from van’t Hoff plots. [t=1.006]

temperature_effects:
The values specified are valid for approx 0 - 500 K. In this temperature range,
temperature effects on the tolerance factor are < 0.002 and therefore assumed
neglible. Higher temperature typcially increases the tolerance factors, as
specified in Dabrowski et al., J Sol State Chem 170 (2003) 154–164,
dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0022-4596(02)00056-7. As a rule of thumb (estimated from
Fig. 6 in Dabrowski et al.): 800 K → 0.005; 1000 K → 0.010; 1300 K → 0.020. Due
to temperature effects, it can make a difference in crystal structure whether a
certain reduction level is obtained thermally or by decrease in partial
pressure!

spin_effects:
select `HS` for high spin configuration and `LS` for low spin configuration
where applicable. Most perovskites show high spin configuration under ambient
temperature and pressure conditions.

reduction_extent: All ions in oxidation state 4+ at 0%, and all ions in oxidation state 3+ at 100%

tolerance_factor.remarks:
to be reached at target reduction extent and RT (approx.  values, dependent on
composition - values listed have been multiplied by 1000)

{ionic_radii.A-site_coordination}

remarks:
Complete 13-fold coordination assumed at 100% and complete 10-fold coordination
assumed at 0%. Mixture assumed at intermediate values. In cubic perovskites CN =
12, in distorted perovskites the coordination number is assumed to decrease (see
references). For SrFeOx, an 80%/20% CN 12/10 ratio gives tolerance factors in
good agreement with the observed crystal structures in our studied cases.
Perovskites with stronger distortion may require different values.

{ionic_radii.tolerance_factor.targets}
>1100: Very high tolerance factor - potentially not a stable perovskite
1035-1100: Hexagonal or rhombohedral structure - most likely stable during reduction
1025-1035: Hexagonal or rhombohedral structure - phase transition to cubic perovskite likely upon reduction
1010-1025: cubic perovskite - typically stable during reduction
1000-1010: cubic perovskites with tetragonal or orthorhombic distortion upon reduction
0970-1000: distorted perovskite - usually orthorhombic or tetragonal
0900-0970: strongly distorted perovskite - potential decomposition upon reduction
<0900: most likely no stable perovskite phase - or strongly distorted perovskite phase
